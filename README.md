## What is Anglish

*From [anglish.org](https://anglish.org/wiki/Anglish):*

Anglish is a kind of English which prefers native words over those borrowed from foreign languages. Anglish is [linguistic purism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_purism) applied to English.

Using the example that YouTuber [Rob Words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMA3M6b9iEY) used, here is the preamble to the US Constitution in modern English vs Anglish.

English:

> "We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."

Anglish:

> "We the Folk of the Foroned Riches, to make a more flawless oneship, build rightness, bring frith and stillness to our land, shield one another, uphold the overall welfare, and hold fast the Blessings of Freedom to ourselves and our offspring, do foresay and lay down this lawbook for the foroned riches of Americksland."
